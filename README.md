# `.files`

This repository is my personal collection of dotfiles.
It's a way for me to ensure consistent settings across different systems and environments. 
Whether I'm spinning up a new virtual machine or setting up a new workstation, these are the configurations I turn to.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DanialHaseeb/dotfiles.git
```

2. Symlink desired dotfiles to your home directory:
```bash
ln -s ~/dotfiles/.zshrc ~/.zshrc
```
Replace `.zshrc` with other dotfiles as needed.

3. Refresh your session or restart your terminal.

## Note

These configurations are tailored to my personal preferences and workflow.
Feel free to browse, but they might not be the perfect fit for everyone!
